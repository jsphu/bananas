# Bananas
**Bananas** are berries, but strawberries arenâ€™t. In botanical terms, a berry is a fruit produced from a single ovary that contains seeds embedded in the flesh. Since bananas fit this definition while strawberries do not (they develop from multiple ovaries), it flips our usual understanding of these fruits on its head!
