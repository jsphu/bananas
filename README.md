# Bananas
**Bananas** are berries, but strawberries arenâ€™t. In botanical terms, a berry is a fruit produced from a single ovary that contains seeds embedded in the flesh. Since **bananas** fit this definition while strawberries do not (they develop from multiple ovaries), it flips our usual understanding of these fruits on its head!

**Bananas** are naturally radioactive! They contain potassium-40, a radioactive isotope of potassium. While the level of radiation is extremely low and not harmful to humans, it's enough that the phrase "**banana** equivalent dose" is sometimes used to explain levels of radiation exposure. So, in a fun twist, eating a **banana** actually gives you a tiny dose of radiation!
